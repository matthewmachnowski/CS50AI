# CS50AI

**Degrees** [see directory](https://github.com/matthewmachnowski/cs50ai/tree/main/degrees):
    
* The assignment is about finding the shortest path between two nodes.
* The solution is based on Breadth-First Search (BFS) because the task requires the shortest path between nodes.
* To implement the search, I used a Queue-based Frontier. The Frontier is filled with neighboring nodes that share the same parameter(movie).
* The database comes from IMDb, and the task is to tell how one actor is connected to another through their common movie casts.

**Tic-Tac-Toe** [see directory](https://github.com/dtemir/harvard-CS50AI/tree/master/tictactoe):

* The assignment is about writing an AI algorithm to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
* The solution is based on Minimax decision rule which perfectly works for games that clash two opponents against each other.
    * The algorithm is all about calculating the best utility out of all possible solutions. 
    * The algorithm relies on calculating prospective steps that the opponent might take
* The `tictactoe.py` file (where the solution lies) consists of many minor functions that construct the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
